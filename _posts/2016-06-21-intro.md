Imagine a tattered, oft-referenced, weather-worn backcountry fieldbook: hand-drawn pictures of edible plants and where to find them, an outline of steps to build a fire, escaping a bear, etc.

This is a guide for debugging performance and stability issues for Rails apps in the same fashion. The guide concisely consolidates the lessons we've learned scaling Rails apps and those of our customers.

A few important notes about this field book:

* __We've limited the why__ - just like a fieldbook is meant to be used as a quick reference guide when in the wild, this guide is meant to be a companion when actively working on a performance or stability issue.
* __Tools and services__ - our examples refernce and share screenshots of our team's view of the best tool for the job. Sometimes that tool is open-source and sometimes it is paid. We value our development time and happily pay for services that give us better development flow. 
* __Chapters are published as we complete them__. The source is available on Github - we welcome your pull requests.
