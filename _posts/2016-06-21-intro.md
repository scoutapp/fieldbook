We've learned lots of lessons scaling Rails apps - many of them the hard way - and we're documenting those lessons here.

A few important notes about this fieldbook:

* __We've limited the why__ - just like a physical fieldbook is meant to be used as a quick reference guide when traveling in the backcountry, this virtual book is meant to be a companion when actively working on a performance or stability issue.
* __Tools and services__ - our examples reference and share screenshots of our team's view of the best tool for the job. Sometimes that tool is open-source and sometimes it is paid. We value our development time and happily pay for services that give us better development flow. 
* __Chapters are published as we complete them__. You can subscribe to new chapters via RSS or email.
* __The source is on Github__. We welcome your comments and suggestions: you can submit a comment or pull request for this fieldbook [on Github](https://github.com/scoutapp/fieldbook).
